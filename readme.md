So First of all i made the code <\br>
Trained it on colab got the .pth files failed<\br> 
agian repeat failed <\br>
so after making 6 google account limit to 0(so like 3*6=18hr of Traning(one colab acc 3 hr of time)) I finaly succeded so then downloaded the files like gpt_epoch_2<\br>
So after doing put it into hugging face then boom it worked but in hugging face also i had to try like 2 times<\br>
So it seems easy but it isnt <\br>
yay thats it also it was fun and learned a lot <\br>
It was my orginal repo for the llm but after file name change and all i made one more repo here is the link : [Link](https://github.com/souptik-samanta/Caesar-Gpt)<\br>
but now i have put all the files here also in the trained_model folder i couldnot add the .pth files as it was too big<\br>
Yay thats all thank you  for reading this long!<\br>
